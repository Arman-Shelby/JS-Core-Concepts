----> Difference between primitive and non-primitive data types:

Primitive Data Types

Definition: Basic, single values.

Examples: String, Number, BigInt, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol.

Stored: By value (directly in memory).

Mutable?: ❌ Immutable (cannot be changed, only replaced).

Comparison: Compared by value.


-------------------------


Non-Primitive Data Types

Definition: Complex data structures that can hold multiple values.

Examples: Object, Array, Function, Date, Map, Set, etc.

Stored: By reference (the variable holds a pointer to memory location).

Mutable?: ✅ Mutable (contents can be modified).

Comparison: Compared by reference (not by value).
